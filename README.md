## Problem statement

  

Design and develop a complete travel planning application where users can:

  

- Create customized **multi-city itineraries**

- Assign **travel dates**, **activities**, and **budgets**

-  **Discover** activities and destinations through search

- Receive **cost breakdowns** and **visual calendars**

-  **Share** their plans publicly or with friends

  

The app must properly use a **relational database** to store and query user-specific itineraries, stops, activities, and estimated expenses. The UI should **adapt dynamically** to each user’s trip flow.
